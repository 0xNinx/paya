## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Redis for Bull queues
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_NAME=paya
```

### Bull Queues
- `subscription-payments` - Recurring payment processing
- `subscription-trials` - Trial end processing
- `subscription-resume` - Subscription reactivation
- `webhook-notifications` - Webhook delivery

## Proration Logic

Proration is calculated when changing plans:

```typescript
proratedAmount = (newPlanDailyRate × daysRemaining) - (oldPlanDailyRate × daysRemaining)
```

- **Upgrades**: Customer pays the difference
- **Downgrades**: Customer receives credit
- **Configurable**: Per-plan proration settings

## Dunning Strategy

Default retry sequence:
1. **Attempt 1**: Email notification + Payment retry (24 hours)
2. **Attempt 2**: Email notification + Payment retry (24 hours)
3. **Attempt 3**: Email notification + Payment retry (24 hours)
4. **Final**: Subscription cancellation

Configurable per plan via `maxRetryAttempts` and `lateFeePercentage`.

## Usage-Based Billing

Supports metered billing:
- Record usage events with metric ID, quantity, and unit price
- Aggregate usage by billing period
- Check against plan limits before allowing usage
- Generate usage-based invoices

## Webhook Events

All subscription events trigger webhooks:
- `subscription.created` - New subscription created
- `subscription.updated` - Subscription modified
- `subscription.cancelled` - Subscription cancelled
- `subscription.paused` - Subscription paused
- `subscription.resumed` - Subscription resumed
- `subscription.trial_ended` - Trial period ended
- `subscription.payment_failed` - Payment processing failed
- `subscription.payment_succeeded` - Payment successful
- `invoice.created` - Invoice generated
- `invoice.paid` - Invoice paid
- `dunning.retry_scheduled` - Payment retry scheduled

## Multi-Currency Support

All monetary fields include currency specification:
- Plans have a currency field
- Invoices inherit subscription currency
- Amounts stored as decimals with 8-digit precision

## Grace Periods and Late Fees

- **Grace Period**: Days after due date before late fees apply
- **Late Fee**: Percentage of invoice amount charged after grace period
- **Configurable**: Per-plan settings

## Testing

### Test Webhook
```bash
POST /subscriptions/webhooks/test
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-domain.com/webhook"
}
```

### Create Test Subscription
```bash
POST /subscriptions
{
  "planId": "plan-uuid",
  "customerId": "customer-uuid",
  "customerEmail": "customer@example.com",
  "trialPeriod": true
}
```

## Monitoring

The system includes built-in monitoring:
- Queue job status logging
- Payment failure tracking
- Dunning action monitoring
- Scheduled task execution logs

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Design**: Create clear plan hierarchies with meaningful names
2. **Proration**: Enable proration for smooth plan transitions
3. **Dunning**: Configure appropriate retry attempts based on your business
4. **Usage Tracking**: Define clear metrics and units for usage-based billing
5. **Webhooks**: Implement idempotent webhook handlers
6. **Testing**: Test plan changes and cancellations thoroughly
7. **Monitoring**: Monitor queue health and payment success rates

## Integration Points

The subscription system integrates with:
- **Payment Service** - For actual payment processing
- **Webhook Service** - For event notifications
- **Blockchain Listener** - For Stellar transaction monitoring
- **Merchant Service** - For merchant validation
