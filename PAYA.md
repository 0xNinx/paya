## Summary

Paya is a payments platform that helps businesses accept cryptocurrency and receive settlement in USDC on the Stellar network. The MVP demonstrates a complete, easy-to-follow checkout → settlement → merchant confirmation flow with on‑chain proof of payment.

---

## Purpose

Many merchants want to accept crypto but struggle with unreliable settlement, confusing reconciliation, and limited auditability. Paya addresses these needs by providing a simple, auditable payment flow: customers pay in crypto and merchants get a clear, verifiable receipt in a stable currency.

---

## What Paya Provides (high level)

- A simple checkout that generates deposit instructions (an address + unique memo).
- Automatic detection of completed payments and a record that shows whether a payment is pending or settled.
- A merchant dashboard that lists payments and shows settlement status so merchants can reconcile quickly.
- Clear, repeatable demo instructions so reviewers and developers can reproduce the whole flow on a public test network.

All of this is delivered as an open-source project so others can inspect, run, and extend it.

---

## How It Works (plain language)

1. Merchant creates a checkout or shares a payment link.
2. Customer opens the checkout, enters the amount, and is given deposit instructions (an address and a unique memo code).
3. Customer sends the specified stablecoin to the address and includes the memo code so the payment is linked to the checkout.
4. Paya watches the public network for that incoming payment; when it appears, the payment is marked as settled.
5. The merchant dashboard shows the settled payment and provides proof that the payment occurred.

This flow gives merchants a user-friendly interface while keeping a tamper-resistant record of payments.

---

## Why This Matters

- Predictable settlement: Merchants receive settlement in USDC, reducing exposure to price swings.
- Low cost & fast: Stellar provides inexpensive, quick transfers suitable for many payment sizes.
- Verifiable records: Payments are recorded where they can be independently inspected, improving trust and simplifying disputes.
- Easy to test: The MVP is designed so reviewers can confirm the end‑to‑end experience without complex setup.

---

## What Reviewers Can Do Quickly

- Open the checkout UI and create a test payment.
- Use a public test wallet or explorer to send the test payment exactly as instructed (address + memo).
- Watch the merchant dashboard update to “settled” and see the same evidence available on the public network.

A short demo video or guided walkthrough can be provided to speed up verification.

## Roadmap (what comes next)

With support, Paya will:
- Strengthen the on‑chain records and perform additional audits/tests.
- Add merchant vaults and programmable splits for marketplaces and revenue sharing.
- Provide a more robust backend for secure signing and production use.
- Publish developer SDKs and integration guides so other teams can adopt Paya easily.
- Offer a hosted demo environment for quick evaluation.

---

## How Grant Funds Will Be Used

Grant funds would be applied to:
- Security hardening and formal testing of payment logic.
- Building vaults and split-payment features needed by marketplaces.
- Implementing production-ready infrastructure (secure signing, persistent storage, and workers).
- Writing clear developer documentation, SDKs, and a short demo video.

Thank you for reviewing Paya. The project is intentionally small and focused so reviewers and small teams can try the full payment flow and see verifiable settlement without heavy infrastructure.
